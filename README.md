# Reddit_france_analysis
Recuperation and transformation of r/france data in order to observe patterns, trends and evolutions. The code is built to be replicable for any other subreddit.

### Objective :
The objective is to give trends and evolutions of subreddit statistics. The idea is to give information that users can ask themselves about traffic, user activity (or their own), the most used words, etc. In the long run, the pipeline should be as automated as possible so that only the name of the subreddit has to be changed.
